## Why?

In League of Legends (and potentially other games), the cursor is not locked properly in borderless mode. This app tries to fix that.


## Mouse acceleration

To remove mouse acceleration I can recommend [LinearMouse](https://linearmouse.org).


## Requirements

Requires MacOS 11.0 or later.
